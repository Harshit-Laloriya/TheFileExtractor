Hi there! This is my special place on the internet called Github. I want to show you something that I made called TheFileExtractor, and I'm really happy about it!This GUI program can retrieve/move the specific file type by identifying the files via these extensions and move all files to the default location or to the user-specified destination path.
This GUI application is so easy to operate and interactive and i also pinned a video link related to this GUI app on how it works, you can take help from there to better understand.
